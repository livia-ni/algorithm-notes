k nearest points:

Given a set of points in a cartesian plane, and a start point , find the k closest points to the starting point.
Points = [(1,2),(2,3),(4,6),(7,9)]
Start Point = (2,2)
Find 2 closest points to start point.

determines whether two rectangles overlap given their top-right and bottom-left coordinates:
if(l2.x > r1.x || l1.x > r2.x) return false;
if(l1.y > r2.y || l2.y > r1.y) return false;
