This can avoid integer exceed the largest number:
   mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
 
Binary search:
   Distinguish when to use < and <=

Java PriorityQueue is implemented as minheap(change the compare() method comparision order to achieve a maxheap)
C++ PriorityQueue is default implemented as maxheap(std::greater<T> would cause the smallest element to appear as the top().)


Java lambda expression (jdk 1.7 and higher)

LinkedList point:
Remember to use dummyhead point to the real head, 
sometimes the real head will need to be deleted according to the question requirement

if the question contains "duplicate" sequence, remember to try to use HashSet to seek for a solution, but not brute force
(add method will return false if the element already exists)
